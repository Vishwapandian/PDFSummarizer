Research Deployment Strategies    a. Create a Deployment Plan – should be based on Architecture Design   2. Finalize Code  – You need to give the executable and give instructions to TA as how to run the code.   3. Run Test Cases   a. Execute 20 test cases for functional requirements.  Each team member work on at least 4  testcases   b. Document result s of the test case as part of the Test Case Plan  – Include inputs, expected  outputs and actual outputs.   4. Update SE Presentation PowerPoint and SE Document from Project Assignment 4  a. Update based on feedback from Project Assignment 4  b. Add in Test  Results, Deployment Sections , and Link in Presentation to working code.     Deliverables   1. SE Presentation as PowerPoint file posted on eLearning as “. PPTx” or “.PDF” (only “.PPTx” or “.PDF”) –  Name as follows ( Groupxx_SE_Presentation_Assignment 5 -Fall2023)  2.

            " Assessment Result  Each assignment will have a criteria based grading Scale of satisfactory (SS), good (G), excellent (EG) based upon the frequency of rating in each category. Two 40% participation marks based on TA through TA comments about your attendance and TA feedback about your code posting. The rest of the 60% (20 + 20 + 20) marks for the tests cases and document.  Test Case Plan: Each of the coding requirement needs to have a set of test cases that can be executed. Four test cases are recommended.   Deployment Section: Each of the coding requirement needs to have a deployment diagram and relevant information about how to execute the code. Document s how to deploy the executable correctly. You provide a detailed instructions including the executable in your homework submission   Project Code for the classes either posted on GitHub or within the following tools Salesforce IDE AWS Code Greenhouse MOBILE. Any other tool that you would like us to support  Documentation: The homework submission is a critical deliverable that needs to be coded inductively and (re)covered for the interactive presentation. No code is allowed in PowerPoint slides.  Note: An earlier checker of the homework comes to class and checks each of the SE class submissions. The checker is not involved in eLearning grading. The eLearning tool will grade the SE submission. Users will be able to download the submission document and complete the grading at the same time with the assignment.  Important: The entire Office of Instruction.Alt hive is not accessible during the Saturday grading session. A document titled “GWC%20Session%20Oct.%2027 6 7PM%20Submission%20Review” lists the expected submission.\n"
